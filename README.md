work track:
planning is good, and took an hour.
graph deployment : I hade a missing 'defer' value in my html script link, and it took me an hour and a half to find. I though it was a problem with making the chart work. deploying it was simple, but finding the problem was hard because of misassumption

now it time to go back to the plan with 1.5 hours delay
